# TrackMe

TrackMe is a portable and wearable GPS Tracker. The device uses an Arduino, a GPS Module, and a HM-10 Bluetooth Module to record and transmit user location data to a Serial Monitor, log data onto an SD Card, or transmit data via the TrackMe App, an IOS Application built specifically for the Tracker.

On this page, you can find code and schematics for three different versions of the tracker: Bluetooth Communication, SD Card Logging, and Serial Transmission. You can also find the code for the TrackMe IOS App.

Enjoy!
